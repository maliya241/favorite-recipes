		<h1>Cutout Sugar Cookies</h1>
		<h2>Ingredients</h2>
		
    1 cup granulated sugar
2 large eggs
2 tsp vanilla bean paste vanilla extract can be substituted
3 - 4 cups all-purpose flour (this will vary from kitchen to kitchen)
1/2 cup cornstarch
1/2 tsp kosher salt
    
    <ul>
			<li>1/2 cup Unsalted Butter, cold *</li>
			<li>1/2 cup Granulated Sugar * </li>
			<li>1 large Egg * </li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Vanilla Extract * </li>
			<li>1 1/2 cups All-Purpose Flour * </li>
			<li>1/4 cup Cornstarch * </li>
			<li>1/4 teaspoon Kosher Salt</li>
			<li>Powdered Sugar</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Directions</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Line baking sheets with parchment paper and set aside.</li>
			<li>To the bowl of a stand mixer, add butter and sugar and cream on MED speed until smooth and well combined. Mix in the eggs, one at a time, until combined. Add vanilla and mix.</li>
			<li>To a mixing bowl, add dry ingredients (flour, cornstarch and salt), and whisk to combine. Add the flour mixture, starting with 3 cups, and mix on MED LOW speed.</li>
			<li>Let mix for 3-5 minutes, and you'll see the dough go from a crumbly mess to pulling itself into a ball that pulls away from the sides of the mixer bowl.</li>
			<li>Turn out the dough onto work surface and roll dough to a thickness of about 1/4 inch. Flouring the work surface and rolling pin is helpful, as is rolling dough out between 2 pieces of wax or parchment paper.</li>
      <li>Cut into shapes and place cut out dough pieces on prepared baking sheets.</li>
			<li>Refrigerate for 15 minutes.</li>
      <li>While dough is chilling, preheat oven to 375&#8457;.</li>
      <li>Bake cookies for 9-11 minutes, or until edges appear set. Cookies won't be golden on the top.</li>
			<li>Remove from oven and let cookies sit on baking sheet for 2-3 minutes, then transfer to a wire cooling rack and cool completely.</li>
      <li>Decorate if desired.</li>
		</ol>
