		<h1>Fluffy Chocolate Frosting</h1>
		<h2>Ingredients</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>6 tablespoons Margarine, cold</li>
			<li>6 tablespoons Water, hot</li>
			<li>6 tablespoons Cocoa Powder</li>
			<li>1 teaspoon Vanilla</li>
			<li>4 cups Powdered Sugar</li>
			<li></li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Directions</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Place water in a microwave-safe bowl and heat until it just begins to boil, approximately 1 1/2 minutes.</li>
			<li>Add cocoa powder to the hot water. Set aside.</li>
			<li>Place cold margarine in a large bowl. Use a hand mixer and mix for 1 – 2 minutes until it begins to soften.</li>
			<li>Add the vanilla to the margarine. Mix well.</li>
			<li>Add 2 cups of powdered sugar to the margarine and mix well.</li>
			<li>Add 2 cups of powdered sugar to the margarine and mix well.</li>
			<li>Slowly add the remaining powdered sugar until you reach the desired consistency.</li>
			<li>Whip the frosting mixture for 1 more minute.</li>
			<li>Then use the icing to decorate your cake or cupcakes.</li>
		</ol>	
		<h2>Notes</h2>
		<p>If your frosting is not as stiff as you would like it, then add more powdered sugar.</p>
		<p>If your frosting is too thick add one teaspoon of cold water. Mix well. Repeat as needed. Do not add more than a teaspoon of water at a time because your frosting can quickly go from too thick to too thin.</p>
		<p>If your frosting is too sweet, add a pinch of salt.</p>
		<p>For dairy-free frosting, use dairy-free margarine.</p>
